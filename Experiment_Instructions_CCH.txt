Experiment Instructions - CCH Dataset
=====================================

Download CCH data folders from the following links.
NOTE: The link names are quite long, each beginning with "https".

Complete both of the following steps.

Step 1 - ROI Identification
--------------------------------------------------
1. Open JupyterLab, clear the image stacks directory and copy the CCH Experiment folders into image_stacks.
2. Open Ratiometric_ROI_Detection in JupyterLab.
3. Run the "Package Import" code block using the play button next to the clipboard icon.
4. Run the "File Import" code block.
5. Run the "Create Results Folder(s)" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
6. Run the "Threshold Sizing Baseline Image(s)" code block, wait until image(s) appear.
7. Run the "Initial Mask Creation" code block, wait until image(s) and widgets appear.
8. Run the "Segmentation" code block, wait until image(s) appear.
9. Run the "Create Removal Mask(s)" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
10. Run the "Display Removal Mask(s)" code block, wait until image(s) and widgets appear.
11. Run the "Submit Removal Selection(s)" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
12. Run the "Finalize Mask(s)" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
13. Run the "Plotting and Data Collection" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
14. If desired (optional), run the "Optional plotting of individual pixel intensities of each ROI and average" code block, wait until "Done." appears.

Step 2 - CSV Peaks Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
1. Open CSV_Peak_Detection in JupyterLab.
2. Run the "Package Import" code block.
3. Run the "Select data files for analysis" code block, wait until "Data Files" widget appears.
   Select the CCH Experiment result folders from Data Files widget.
4. Run the "Create a new analysis results directory" code block, wait until "Done." appears.
5. Run the "Choose which region columns to analyze" code block, wait until "Region cols" widget(s) appear.
6. Run the "Initial Data Plotting" code block, wait until plot(s) appear.
   Set "Number of stimulation time zones for all plots:" to 3.
7. Skip over the three "Anomaly/Artifact Removal" code blocks.
8. Run the "Set stimulation time zone ranges" code block, wait until plot(s) appear.
   Select range of stimulation zones using "Stimulation zone" sliding range widget.
   Set the zone ranges to 50-300, 350-600, and 650-900.
9. Run the "Plot data and stimulation time zones" code block, wait until plot(s) appear.
   Check the "Check this box to have automatic baselines for all" widget.
   Check the "Check this box to have starting baseline for all" widget.
10. Run the "Peak counting and latency calculation settings" code block, wait until plot(s) and widgets appear.
    Set the "Slope calculation method" to "gaussian fit".
11. Run "Plot peaks and calculate latencies by region" code block, wait until plots stop being output and it says "Idle" at bottom of window.
12. View results in the results folder.
