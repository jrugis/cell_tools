Complete steps 1 and 2, then optionally steps 3 and 4.

Step 1 - ROI Identification
------------------------------------------------
1. Open JupyterLab, clear the image stacks directory and copy the GCAMP data files into cell_tools/IMAGING/image_stacks.
2. Open the ROI_Detection notebook in JupyterLab
3. Run the "Initialize" code block.
4. Run the "Select image stack file(s)" code block.
   Select all four of the "Mistgcamp-3" files.
5. Run the "Enter short descriptive image stack labels" code block.
   Type in the four labels "1Hz", "2Hz", "5Hz", "10Hz".
6. Run the "Set display and calculation parameters" code block.
   Set the "Image stack for ROI creation" to "5Hz".
   Set the "Calculation method" to "std".
7. Run the "Create a new time-stamped results directory" code block.
8. Run the "Get the image stack for ROI creation" code block.
9. Run the "Unstimulated average (or standard deviation) over time" code block.
   Plots will appear.
10. Run the "Stimulated average (or standard deviation) over time" code block.
   Plots will appear.
11. Run the "Stimulated minus unstimulated average (or standard deviation) over time" code block.
    Plots will appear.
12. Run the "Create region-of-interest mask" code block.
    Plots will appear.
13. Optionally run the "FOR REFERENCE: Annotate the ROI mask regions by number" code block.
    A plot will appear.
14. Optionally run the "DIAGNOSTIC: Plot ROI responses for the same stimulation frequency used to generate the mask" code block.
    A number of plots will appear.
15. Run the "RESULTS: Plot responses for all stimulation frequencies and regions using the mask from above" code block.
    After a few seconds, a number of plots will appear.

Step 2 - Post-Processing: Peak Detection
------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Peak_Detection notebook in JupyterLab
2. Run the "Initialize" code block.
3. Run the "Select a results directory and peak counting options" code block.
   Select the most current GCAMP results directory.
4. Run the "Peak counting over all regions" code block.
   Plots will appear.

Step 3 - Post-Processing: Frequency Analysis
------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Frequency_Analysis notebook in JupyterLab
2. Run the "Initialize" code block.
3. Run the "Select a results directory and set analysis frame range" code block.
   Select the most current GCAMP results directory.
4. Run the "Frequency analysis of results over all regions" code block.
   A number of plots will appear.
5. Re-run the "Select a results directory and set analysis frame range" code block.
   Select the most current GCAMP results directory.
   Set the "Calculation method" to "FFT".
6. Re-run the "Frequency analysis of results over all regions" code block.
   A number of plots will appear.

Step 4 - Post-Processing: Movie Making
------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Movie_Making notebook in JupyterLab
2. Run the "Initialize" code block.
3. Run the "Select an image stack, a results directory and one or more regions" code block.
   Select the image stack "Mistgcamp-3_0002.tif".
   Select the most current GCAMP results directory.
   Select regions "region_01-mask5Hz-stimALL", "region_02-mask5Hz-stimALL", 
                  "region_03-mask5Hz-stimALL", "region_04-mask5Hz-stimALL",
                  "region_05-mask5Hz-stimALL", "region_06-mask5Hz-stimALL",
                  "region_07-mask5Hz-stimALL", "region_08-mask5Hz-stimALL",
                  "region_09-mask5Hz-stimALL", "region_10-mask5Hz-stimALL"
4. Run the "Select movie options" code block.
5. Run the "Generate the movie file" code block.
   Wait until the "Processing frame" count says "Done."
   The movie file "apical.mp4" can be found in the time-stamped results directory.
